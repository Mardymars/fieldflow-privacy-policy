<h1>FieldFlow Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 26, 2026</p>

<p>FieldFlow ("we", "our", or "the app") is an independently developed application created by Adel Marcano.</p>

<p>FieldFlow is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania or any related legal entities.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Authentication identifiers through Firebase Authentication: anonymous UID, email-format login identifier and password credential, or phone number (if phone login is used)</li>
  <li>We do not require email verification</li>
  <li>Email-style login may use an alias/username formatted like an email address</li>
  <li>User-generated content such as streets, addresses, notes, congregation information, assignments, reminders, follow-ups, and submissions</li>
  <li>Device/browser local app data stored in local storage (such as settings, drafts, tags, calendar cache, and congregation context)</li>
  <li>Optional backup files created by users may include <code>fieldflow:*</code> local data and user hints (such as UID, email, or phone when present)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To authenticate users and keep data associated with the correct account</li>
  <li>To synchronize app data across devices</li>
  <li>To provide reminders/notifications and core app functionality</li>
  <li>To support official congregation workflows, including manager/founder review of submitted content</li>
  <li>To maintain reliability and resolve technical issues</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>FieldFlow uses Google Firebase services, including Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.</p>
<p>FieldFlow also stores some app data in local device/browser storage.</p>
<p>Data sent to Firebase is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections and stored within Firebase infrastructure.</p>
<p>Backup files are stored wherever the user chooses to save them.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or monetize user data.</p>
<p>Data may be processed by infrastructure providers necessary to operate the app, such as Google Firebase.</p>
<p>Users may intentionally share exported content using device/browser share features.</p>
<p>In official congregation workflows, submitted content may be visible to authorized managers/founders for review.</p>

<h2>5. Intended Use</h2>
<p>FieldFlow is primarily intended to assist members of Jehovah's Witnesses in organizing field ministry information. The app may also be used by the general public for lawful personal organizational purposes.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>FieldFlow is not directed toward children under age 13 and is not intended for child use.</p>

<h2>7. Account and Data Deletion</h2>
